# EmojiArt

An iPad app for creating emoji-based art compositions by dragging and dropping emojis onto a canvas.

Based on the materials of the course [Stanford CS193p: Developing Apps for iOS using SwiftUI (Spring 2023)](https://cs193p.stanford.edu/2023).

## Description

- Built with SwiftUI using the MVVM architecture  
- Targeted for iPad (iPadOS 16+) with multitouch gesture support  
- Drag-and-drop of emojis from the palette onto a resizable and pannable canvas
- Pinch-to-zoom and pan gestures for manipulating the canvas  
- Background image selection via drag-and-drop or URL input  
- State management with `@ObservableObject` and `@Published`  
- Persistence of the document model (saving and restoring)  
- Demonstrates advanced SwiftUI concepts: geometry, gesture handling, drag & drop, persistence 

## Skills Demonstrated

- SwiftUI (layouts, animations, gestures)  
- MVVM architecture  
- Reactive state management (`@Published`, `@ObservableObject`)  
- UIKit interoperability (drag & drop integration)  
- iPadOS app design and multitouch support  
- File/document persistence
